Welcome!

Welcome to the first VARI introduction to Linux and the shell workshop!

Let's first talk about a couple of things before we get started, beginning with something essential for the success of everyone today.

Code of conduct

This is meant to be a safe and friendly space that is amenable to learning something new. 
This new thing can and will likely be frustrating but requires that questions be asked throughout the workshop. I promise someone else is thinking the same thing you are!

This workshop and all subsequent workshops will adhere to the following code of conduct: https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/

Learning goals
--------------

What will you, hopefully, leave with as new skills today?

* Find the shell on your computer

* Navigate the file tree

* Look at and manipulate large files

* Automate *some* tasks

.. _sticky:

Sticky notes and minute cards
-----------------------------

The sticky notes are a way for you to communicate to us as instructors.

**No sticky note** = "Still working on it"

**Green sticky note** = "All is well"

**Red sticky note** = "Help please!"

Place the sticky notes on the back of your laptop screen if you need to or are asked to use them.

Concluding each session (stretch your legs, coffee break, end of day) we will hand out index cards and we ask that you write **one thing you learned** and **one thing you're still confused about** on them.

.. _warning:

Warning
-------

This will likely be frustrating. Computers are literal. They will do *exactly* what you ask them to do. If you add an extra space here or there, or give it a file that doesn't exist, it will complain and not do what you hoped it would do.

BUT! We've brought coffee and have some instructors who'd love to help alleviate that frustration and show you the power you wield over your machine to analyze large datasets.

Now, :ref:`let's get started! <getstarted>`
