Additional shell and bioinformatics resources
=============================================

**Shell**

* Software Carpentry tutorial - [The Unix shell](http://software-carpentry.org/v4/shell/index.html)
* The shell handout - [Command Reference](http://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
* [explainshell.com](http://explainshell.com)
* http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html
* man bash
* Google - if you don't know how to do something, try Googling it. Other people
have probably had the same question.
* Learn by doing. There's no real other way to learn this than by trying it
out.  Write your next paper in nano (really emacs or vi), open pdfs from
the command line, automate something you don't really need to automate.


**Other bioinformaticsy things to make your life easier on the command line**
